**Problem 1**
Got expected values of Dn of 1/2 for all three dimensions.  Present error decreases significantly from N=5000 to N=10000 runs.


**Problem 2**
Had an issue with getting tensorflow probability to work, fixed it by uninstalling tf-nighty, tfp-nightly and tfp, and then reinstalling tfp stable version.  The issue was the the clash of versions.
Got the program to run as expected.
